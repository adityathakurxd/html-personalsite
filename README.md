# Personal Website made using HTML

**Link:** https://adityathakurxd.github.io/html-personalsite/

I have only yesterday (at the time of this commit) started with HTML.
While learning it, I followed along with a Personal Site tutorial made entirely in HTML.
The website has:

 - a profile picture displayed
 - uses formating and emphasis
 - has tables to better display data
 - links to other pages
 - a contact form that emails details

## Only HTML
